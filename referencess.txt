A session is a way to store information (in variables) to be used across multiple pages.

Unlike a cookie, the information is not stored on the users computer.
Session variables are set with the PHP global variable: $_SESSION.


session_destroy(); is deleting the whole session.

session_unset(); deletes only the variables from session - session still exists. Only data is truncated.
